Late lies the wintry sun a-bed,	     	 	       	     	      	     
      		   	  	 	     	  	      	   
A frosty, fiery sleepy-head;	     	       	       	    	      	   
     			     	  	   	     	  	       	     
Blinks but an hour or two; and then,  	  	     		 	       
      	     
A blood-red orange, sets again.



Before the stars have left the skies,

At morning in the dark I rise;

And shivering in my nakedness,

By the cold candle, bathe and dress.



Close by the jolly fire I sit

To warm my frozen bones a bit;

Or with a reindeer-sled, explore

The colder countries round the door.



When to go out, my nurse doth wrap

Me in my comforter and cap;

The cold wind burns my face, and blows

Its frosty pepper up my nose.



Black are my steps on silver sod;

Thick blows my frosty breath abroad;

And tree and house, and hill and lake,

Are frosted like a wedding cake.
