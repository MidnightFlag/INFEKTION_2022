<p>Is there anywhere Java can't go? In this issue, Peter Meehan shows that you can even run Java in the palm of your hand (see "Developing for the PalmOS Platform using J2ME," p. 13.) Vendors are taking some interesting approaches to getting Java into embedded systems, including bypassing the OS and JVM entirely, and going "directly to the metal." There's no question that other vendors in addition to Sun deserve credit for Java's success. We have seen them make heroic efforts to make Java work in unfriendly environments. The eternal question is "why?"</p>
<p>I always pose this question to Java vendors when I go to trade shows. I ask them why we should bother to use Java when C and C++ would work just as well. A couple years ago I was given the P word &#151; Productivity. The typical programmer would supposedly be more productive using Java than using C or C++. Today when I ask this question, I get different answers. Java is more Internet-aware; it is easier to integrate into multi-platform environments; it really does, for the most part, live up to its promised portability.</p>
<p>All right, I'll buy that. I like these reasons more than the P word. Maybe it's just my C/C++ bias, but I have always felt mildly insulted by the notion that <I>taking away</I> a feature (like pointers) from me would make me more productive. But, as always, I would like to hear what you have to say about it. I would especially like to hear from experienced C++ programmers who have taken up Java. Do you feel that, on the whole, you are more productive when you write code in Java? What <I>are</I> your reasons for using Java (besides "my employer made me")? Visit our website (<B>www.cuj.com/java</B>) and send us a message. We would really like to hear from you.</p>
<p>By the way, while you're at the website: we are looking for extremely short articles, tips, one-pagers, and book reviews on Java for future issues of <I>Java Solutions.</I> If you write one and we print it, we'll send you a nice <I>CUJ</I> shirt (they really <I>are</I> nice &#151; I'm wearing one right now) and a copy of the <I>CUJ</I> CD-ROM, which contains all the <I>Java Solutions</I> we have printed to date, in addition to ten years' worth of <I>CUJ.</I></p>
