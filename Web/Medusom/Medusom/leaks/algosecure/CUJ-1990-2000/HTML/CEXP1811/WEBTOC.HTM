Conversations: By Any Other Name 
When the pressure’s on, we overlook good solutions, and sometimes for trivial reasons. Guess which well-known pattern our hero is about to about to miss — and all because it’s poorly named.

Book Review: Exceptional C++
 
We reviewed Exceptional C++ in the February 2000 issue of CUJ. Now Stan Lippman gives us a second look at this very important book. Stan is a former editor of C++ Report magazine, a C++ language expert, and a respected C++ author, whose books include Inside the C++ Object Model and C++ Primer, Third Edition (co-authored with Josée Lajoie).

From Mechanism to Method: Function Follows Form
 
Of all the features of C++ that can affect source code readability, operator overloading is one of the most powerful. Operator overloading can render otherwise well-written code obscure; on the other hand, it makes possible many important idioms — smart pointers, function objects, and iterators, to name a few. Kevlin Henney shows us another good application of operator overloading: a remember_function that bundles a target object together with a member function pointer for later callback.

Object Interconnections: The History of the OMG C++ Mapping 
CORBA is a distributed object computing system that aims to be programming language neutral, but ultimately, all CORBA programs must be implemented in one or more programming languages. What enables this to happen is the existence of mappings between CORBA and those languages. Good mappings are thus critical to the long-term success of CORBA. Schmidt and Vinoski recount the process of developing a C++ mapping for CORBA, a process that was by turns both technical and political. It makes for fascinating reading, and it underscores both the difficulty and importance of standardization.

The Standard Librarian 
C++ lets you use both iostreams and stdio I/O in the same program. But watch out if you mix iostreams and stdio calls to the same stream! The result will likely be garbled input or output, unless you use the iostreams sync_with_stdio facility. This facility, in effect, causes an iostreams stream and its stdio counterpart to share the same buffer. There are a number of ways for libraries to implement this buffer sharing, and all of them come at a cost. As Austern shows, if you know a few things about how iostreams work you can help minimize this cost and ensure effective cooperation between iostreams and stdio.
