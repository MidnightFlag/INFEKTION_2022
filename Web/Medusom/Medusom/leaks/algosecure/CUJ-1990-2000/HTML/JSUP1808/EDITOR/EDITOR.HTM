<p>We editors at <I>CUJ</I> have had a hard time knowing what to do with Java. Java is like the long-forgotten cousin who shows up at the doorstep one day expecting to be wined and dined. Yes, we can see a definite family resemblance; he appears to be a relative. But his ways are ... strange. We noticed right away that this Java dude is kinda slow. Not the zippiest turtle crossing the freeway. There's also that quirk he has about always taking out his own garbage. But what's really annoying is his insistence on having his special "environment" with him wherever he goes, a thing he calls the JVM. Can he really be a member of the C family?</p>
<p>We have deliberated often on whether to include Java content in <I>CUJ.</I> That depends on a couple of things: what we're trying to accomplish as a magazine, and how you view Java as a programming language.</p>
<p>On the first point, we don't want <I>CUJ</I> to become just a grab bag of tips and tricks. We want to provide in-depth understanding of the languages we cover. The closer the resemblance among two or more languages, the easier it is treat them adequately in a single magazine. On the second point, it would sure simplify things to say we're the magazine for C and C++ programmers and leave it at that &#151; no Java allowed. But that might not serve our audience very well, if most of our readers considered Java as more a variant of C and C++ than a separate language. Then they would naturally want to find information about Java in the same place.</p>
<p>This supplement is sort of a compromise. It's a way of letting our cousin Java in the door, but without full kitchen privileges. As always, we would like to hear your feedback. Specifically, we would like to hear:</p>
<UL><LI>   whether you think Java should be on equal footing with C and C++ in <I>CUJ</I> (meaning we'd be just as apt to print a "pure Java" article as a C or C++ article)
<LI>   whether you want to continue to take your Java as a supplement
<LI>   whether you want us to start up a separate magazine called <I>Java Users Journal</I> (no promises on this one)
<LI>   whether you want to see any Java at all, either in <I>CUJ</I> or as a supplement</UL>
<p>Beyond these things, we would like to know about your experience using Java along with C and C++. When you switch from one language to the next is it like walking from room to room, or is it as jarring as hitting a curb at 90 miles an hour? The answer to that could be key in deciding whether Java belongs in <I>CUJ.</I></p>
<p>Last but not least, a very simple question: how well do you like Java as a programming language?</p>
<p>If you feel like commenting on these questions, please send us a message. We have set up a special website (www.cuj.com/java) where you can give us feedback. We already know our readers are using Java; we're just not too sure <I>how.</I> Your answers will help us set the future course of <I>CUJ.</I></p>
