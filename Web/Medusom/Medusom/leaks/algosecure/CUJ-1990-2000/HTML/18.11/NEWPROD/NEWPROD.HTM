<H4><FONT COLOR="#000080">Green Hills Software Announces New Debug Mode for MULTI 2000</FONT></H4>

<p>Green Hills Software, Inc. has announced the release of a new debug mode for the MULTI 2000. The new debug mode, an enhancement to Green Hills' MULTI 2000 IDE, enables designers to debug multithreaded applications using the ThreadX RTOS on a thread-by-thread basis while the application continues to run. Run-mode debugging enables programmers to halt and examine specific threads in their system while the remaining threads continue to run. Each time a thread hits a breakpoint, MULTI 2000 IDE halts that thread and opens a source code debug window specific to that thread. Programmers can then single step or browse through the halted thread and read memory and registers, all without disrupting program execution.</p>
<p>The first single-user MULTI/ThreadX license for Windows 95/98/NT, including the MULTI IDE, a Green Hills C/C++/EC++ compiler, assembler/linker, ThreadX Kernel Awareness Package, and a project license for the ThreadX RTOS starts at $15,400.</p>
