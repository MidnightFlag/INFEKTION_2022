Pléiades is an optical satellite constellation providing very high-resolution products (50cm) with a 20km swath.
Both the space and the ground segment have been designed to provide information in record time, offering daily revisit capacity to any point on the globe and outstanding acquisition capabilities to meet the full spectrum of civil and military requirements.
The Pléiades constellation is the right answer to extract accurate information and bring powerful insight to make informed decisions.

Pléiades Constellation
SPOT 7
Pléiades 1A With four satellites – Pléiades 1A and 1B, and SPOT 6 and 7 – launched in a two-year time frame, Airbus Defence and Space Intelligence is giving its customers the very best that space technology has to offer.
Ensuring continuity of Earth optical imaging service up to 2024, these satellites operate as a true constellation, combining a twice-daily revisit capability with an ingenious range of resolutions.

SPOT 6
The Pléiades twins are very high-resolution satellites delivering 50 cm Ortho products as standard. SPOT 6 and 7 are designed to extend SPOT 5’s success to the
1.5 m product family. Phased on the same orbit, the combined Pléiades and SPOT 6/7 optical constellation enjoys unprecedented reactivity, with same-day revisit capacity anywhere on Earth. Multiple-tasking plans per day result in an unrivalled optimisation of data collection. Unforeseen weather changes, as well as last-minute requests, can be taken into account for a first-class level of service.
The Pléiades1A and Pléiades 1B were launched on a Soyuz ST from Europe’s space port in Kourou, French Guiana, on December 17, 2011 and on December 2,
2012, respectively.
